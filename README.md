# Game Survival
This is a side project initiated by a group of students from Data Hacking Hours of DePaul University. The goal of this project is to hone our skills in web-based game development and machine learning.

This is a Javascript-based game simulation powered by [Phaser] (https://phaser.io/). The goal is to build an environment where agents can collect food point or prey on other agents. Overtime, they will learn necessary survival strategies to plan and act on pursuing benefit while avoiding threats.
